# Retina-Image-Analysis
This repository included code I completed during mice retina image analysis project.

generate_gauss.py will create a 2D gaussian distribution for each annotation dot and add all the number together.
It will also plot a 3D plot to show the distribution.

data_augmentation included random image cropping, transposing, flipping.

GUI is a simple user interface which can do simple image processing and count cell numbers in a image.
